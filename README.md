# MCServer-start.bat
My slightly modified bat file for starting my Minecraft server. Compatible with any Minecraft server JAR version.
There are comments in the bat file explaining every customizable part of the script.
Free to use and share. If you want to distribute this file yourself, you need to credit me. Thanks.
